What is the Java programming language used for? 
Because Java is a free-to-use and a versatile language, it builds localised and distributed software. Some common uses of Java include:
1.     Game Development
2.     Cloud computing
3.        Big Data
4.     Artificial Intelligence
5.     Internet of Things
How does Java work?
All programming languages are a means to communicate with machines. Machine hardware only responds to electronic communication. High-level programming languages like Java act as a bridge between human language and hardware language. To use Java, a developer needs to understand two things:
The Java program was the first language to combine both methods above using a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java code compiler is called the Java Virtual Machine. Any Java file is first compiled into bytecode. Java bytecode can only run in the JVM. The JVM then interprets the bytecode to run it on the underlying hardware platform. So if the application is running on a Windows machine, the JVM will interpret it for Windows. But if it is running on an open-source platform like Linux, the JVM will interpret it for Linux.
